# Version history

## v1. 
Focused on the Paris region, the first version (only in english) allows to explore the population present over 24 hours of the day according to three indicators (total population, level of education and socioprofessional status of the household), with two modes of representation (choropleth maps and proportional symbol maps). 
[May 2017] 

## v2.
In the second version (still focused on the Paris region), six new indicators have been included (sex, age, income, occupational status, residential areas and activity). 
Flows (from residential districts) have been adeed.
[September 2017] 

## v3.
In the third version, new cities have been added. 
A bilingual interface (French/English) is proposed.

## v4.0. - ONLINE -
26 French cities have been added and data for Valenciennes region have been updated from the EMC² 2019 survey. 18 peripherical districts for the Bordeaux region (2009) have been added. Corrections were also made on estimates of the present populations in Canadian cities. 

New indicators are added: 
* The whole present population can be splitted into two groups (resident versus non resident) according the original district of residence.
* Present population density (people per km²) is now available for the 'Whole population' indicator.  
* It is now possible to distinguish people according to whether they reside or not in the 'Poverty Areas' (ie. Quartiers Priortaires en Politique de la Ville). For France only.

In this fourth version, users can freely download the French data aggregated by hour and district - available under ODbL license. 

Lastly, this new version is undergoing a major overhaul of its interface : graphic design and addition of OpenStreetMap layers.
